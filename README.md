### Moin ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mark Michaelis. I am a software developer since 2000 with main focus on Java. Prior to that I started coding with LPC, the language of [LDMud](http://www.ldmud.eu/) and I controlled some robots with C and C++ at the University of Ulm, Germany. Not to forget some virtual robots in Matlab ðŸ¤–

While my main focus at university were neural nets, my main passion today is quality assurance, playing with my favorite tools like JUnit 5 (Jupiter) and AssertJ.

Since 2005 I love working at [CoreMedia](https://www.coremedia.com/).
